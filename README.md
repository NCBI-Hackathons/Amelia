## Machine Learning Tool for Phenotype-Genotype Association

Initially a disease for which gene expression data is available is selected.  We select diabetes cohort from SRA.  RNASeq data from diabetes and control patients is extracted.  In addition, we select a set of genes pertaining to a disease-causing mutation of interest.  We select cystic fibrosis causing SNPs from ClinVar that are extracted using routines written in Python.
